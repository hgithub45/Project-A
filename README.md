## Problem Statement

Air quality has become a critical public health issue in India, with several cities frequently experiencing hazardous levels of air pollution. Power BI, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool, will be used to analyze and visualize air quality data across various regions of India.

## Methodology


Data Collection: Gather air quality data from various sources. The data will cover multiple pollutants and span several years to ensure a comprehensive analysis.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Use Power BIâ€™s Power Query to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring it is in a suitable format for analysis. This step will involve handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.

Data Visualization: Create interactive dashboards and visualizations in Power BI to display air quality trends, pollutant levels, and regional comparisons. Visualizations will include various graphs. 

## Objectives


ðŸ ¶ Assess Air Quality Trends: Evaluate temporal trends in air quality across different regions in India to identify patterns and variations. 

ðŸ ¶ Identify Major Pollutants: Determine the primary pollutants contributing to poor air quality, such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO.

ðŸ ¶ Regional Analysis: Conduct a regional analysis to identify areas with the highest levels of pollution and compare them with areas having relatively cleaner air.
